# MineSweeper Game

## Overview

This project implements a simple console-based MineSweeper game in Java. It uses arrays, ArrayLists, custom classes, and various methods to simulate the classic Minesweeper gameplay.

## Features

-   **Game Board Creation:** The program creates a game board based on user-defined dimensions using arrays.
-   **Mine Generation:** Random mines are generated and placed on the game board.
-   **User Input Handling:** Allows the player to input coordinates to make moves and interact with the game.
-   **Mine Detection:** The program detects if the player's chosen cell contains a mine.
-   **Neighbour Cell Analysis:** Determines the number of neighboring mines around a selected cell and updates the game board accordingly.
-   **Game Loop:** Provides a loop to keep the game running until the player either wins or hits a mine.
-   **Game Status Display:** Displays the game board and status messages to the console.

## Usage

1.  Run the `Main.java` file to start the game.
2.  Follow the on-screen prompts to define the game board dimensions and make moves.
3.  Avoid hitting mines by strategically selecting cells.
4.  Continue playing until you win by revealing all safe cells or hit a mine.
